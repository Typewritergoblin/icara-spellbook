**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you touches water

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, M (a small feather or a piece of down)

**Duration**: 1 minute

Choose up to five willing creatures within range weighing 500 lbs or less. Those creatures become buoyant until the spell ends. The creature will bob upon the surface unless forcefully dragged under by another force. This does not mean they automatically bob face up and they are still at the mercy of waves, currents or other forces.
